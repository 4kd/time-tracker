{-| This is a merger of Material.Textfield.render and Form.Input.textInput.  Here are their respective type signatures:

#### Material.Textfield

The `render` function has the following type signature as of this writing:

```
render
  : (Parts.Msg (Container c) m -> m)
  -> Parts.Index
  -> (Container c)
  -> List (Property m)
  -> Html m
```

#### Form

The `textInput` function has the following type signature as of this writing:

```
textInput : Input e String
```

So it just returns an `Input`.  The type for Form.Input is defined as follows
as of this writing:

```
{-| An input renders Html from a field state and list of additional attributes.
    All input functions using this type alias are pre-wired with event handlers.
-}
type alias Input e a =
  FieldState e a -> List (Attribute Msg) -> Html Msg
```

Initially, this is not terribly clear to me.  Ultimately I realized that type
resolves to `Html Msg` once the baseInput is applied to the value returned
from `Form.getFieldAsString`.  Here's the definition of `baseInput`:

```
baseInput : String -> (String -> Field) -> Input e String
baseInput t toField state attrs =
  let
    formAttrs =
      [ type' t
      , value (state.value ?= "")
      , onInput (toField >> (Input state.path))
      , onFocus (Focus state.path)
      , onBlur (Blur state.path)
      ]
  in
    input (formAttrs ++ attrs) []
```

So here we can see that the `Input` type is a function that takes a
`FieldState` and a `List (Attribute Msg)` to produce an `Html Msg`.  So the
value we fetched with `Form.getFieldAsString` satisfies the first argument,
and our empty list is the list of attributes we want to bolt on.

render just needs to pass the corresponding Form-related handlers to the
Material.render function and handle mapping the various `Msg` types
appropriately...it's not extremely straightforward but it's entirely
scrutable...

We'll also make it a little less 'generic' because we don't need to, so don't
think you can immediately take this and turn it into a genericizable(-ifiable)
module without a bit more work, mnkay?
